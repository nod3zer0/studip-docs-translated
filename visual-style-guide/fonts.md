### Preliminary remark

A standardized font is used in Stud.IP. In contrast to earlier versions, in which the operating system and browser determined the font (usually Arial or Helvetica, sans serif fonts), this is now determined by the Stud.IP stylesheets. This offers a number of advantages (fixed formatting sizes, tends to be more like in print designs) but also disadvantages (different display, readability, problems with web fonts in certain browsers).

### Lato font

The Lato font is used throughout Stud.IP. Lato is a freely available Google font:
