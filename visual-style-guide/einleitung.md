The Stud.IP Styleguide is always a work in progress.


For current design questions, we from the Styleguide team (AndrÃ©, Cornelis, Marcus, Marco) offer a design consultation hour via video conference every Thursday at 14.00 until further notice. The conference will take place in Skype.




Stud.IP accompanies the students through many years of their studies and is a constant companion for the lecturers in their daily work. This requires Stud.IP to have a certain constant ability to motivate students, to integrate new functions consistently and harmoniously into the overall picture and to ensure that repetitive work processes can be completed as easily and quickly as possible.
These and other requirements are reflected in the Stud.IP design philosophy that guides this style guide:


Ease of use instead of a wide range of functions: less is more and therefore Stud.IP should only provide those functions that help the majority of users. The aim is to support the needs of 80% of users instead of overburdening the larger group with the special requirements of the remaining 20%.
The same range of functions for all events instead of individual adaptation to specific needs: Users thus receive a reliable environment regardless of use in very different teaching and learning situations.
Reliability in operation: Similar functions should always be implemented consistently. Proven patterns are used throughout the system. New approaches should be used consistently so that the entire software benefits from further development, even if this means greater effort during implementation.
Careful integration of new technologies: The use of new Internet, browser or media technologies should not should only be used if an improvement is technically available to a large proportion of users. At the same time, it must be ensured that older configurations are supported to an appropriate extent so that usability is guaranteed.
Stud.IP is fully usable on mobile devices as well as on desktop computers. However, there is no pure "mobile first" principle: mobile pages can offer limited functionalities in certain areas (especially for administrators).


## Four general design principles for Stud.IP


"...the basic principles of design that appear in every well-designed piece of work."
> Robin Williams, The Non-Designer's Design Book


### Visual design


There is a lot to consider when it comes to the visual design of elements within a page. A simple way to quickly increase the usability of the respective page is to observe the four C.R.A.P. principles:
* Contrast
* Repetition (Repetition)
* Alignment
* Proximity


The rules presented below are also available as a poster Attach:studip-design-poster-final.pdf.


### Contrast
* Contrast is used as a design tool to clearly distinguish different page elements from one another.
* Contrast can be used to focus on important content.
* Elements that are not the same should be clearly distinguishable from one another.
* Contrast can be achieved using various design elements, e.g. font, color, sizes, shapes, proximity, etc.


#### Negative examples
* Upload files in events - 9 identical-looking buttons in a row


### Repetition (repetitions):
* Repetition creates consistency in the system
* Consistent design improves the usability of the system
* Consistency can be created through the repeated use of various design elements:
  ** Abstract: menu structures, function sequences
  ** Concrete: icons, fonts, labels


#### Examples
* Main navigation bar remains the same
* Footer remains the same
* Infobox/sidebar


#### Negative examples
* Different search form variants for the person search


### Alignment:
* Content elements should not be placed randomly on a page, but should be aligned horizontally and vertically with other elements.
  Tips
* Text should be aligned to the left or right, but not both at the same time on one page.
* Spacing should be even.
* No right-aligned text in a right-hand side column. This creates too much whitespace.
* Draw guidelines to detect deviations


#### Negative example
* Wizard for creating events


### Proximity
* Content elements that are close together give the impression that they belong together:
* Related content elements should therefore be grouped close to each other.
* There should be enough space between different content elements, otherwise an impression of togetherness is created.
* The grouping of elements increases clarity and content is better structured.


#### Negative example
* Group management - participants of an event or calendar/address book - button for adding to a group is too far away
