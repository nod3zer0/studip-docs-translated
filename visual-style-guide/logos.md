The download package with all logo variants can be downloaded permanently at the following address:

http://bit.ly/studip-logo

This package contains the two basic forms in different color variants as well as extensions (logo for Stud.IP e.V., Stud.IP mobile etc.). The package will be updated regularly when further variants are created by the graphic designer.

## Usage

In general, the variant with the figurative mark will be used in the color variant in the future. For dark backgrounds, there is a variant that is predominantly white. Only in selected cases (e.g. in continuous text or as a watermark) can the variant without the figurative mark and possibly in the monochrome version be used.
