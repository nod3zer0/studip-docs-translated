The first efforts to standardize things on the Internet began in the early 1990s and have been driven forward since 1994, primarily by the World Wide Web Consortium, better known as the W3C consortium, which develops technical specifications and guidelines and makes them transparent. Standardized technologies include HTML and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, WCAG for short.


## WCAG 1.0
The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), which is part of the W3C consortium, created a collection of recommendations that was published in 1999. This contains around 60 individual points in three different priorities (A, AA, AAA) in 14 categories that a website should fulfill. The individual categories concentrate very much on the technical aspects, in particular HTML and CSS, but otherwise WCAG 1.0 remains quite non-binding with regard to the implementation of the points and subsequent validation.


## WCAG 2.0
WCAG 2.0 received recommendation status on December 11, 2008. In contrast to WCAG 1.0, they no longer focus on HTML and CSS as the most important standards of the Internet, but describe in more general terms how layouts, interactions, etc. must be designed so that the offer is accessible. The implementation of these guidelines for individual technologies such as HTML, Java, Flash or PDF is the responsibility of the respective institutions or companies. This means that the WCAG remain open to the rapid technological developments of the internet and new technologies can be integrated.
In June 2018, WCAG 2.1 was adopted as a W3C standard, which deals primarily with visual impairments and cognitive impairments as well as mobile use. [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/ https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG20-de/]


The WCAG test is a test procedure for testing the accessibility of websites. It was developed as part of the "BIK - barrier-free information and communication" project series funded by the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and makes the requirements of WCAG manageable, although this test is not useful in relation to a learning management system as opposed to a website.




## Testing Stud.IP for accessibility
Based on this finding, the Accessibility Working Group, with the help of Stud.IP e.V., had a Stud.IP 4.6 and a Stud.IP 5.0 installation tested by an agency specializing in testing learning management systems, among other things, and used the detailed reports to draw up a catalog of measures to make Stud.IP more accessible using a so-called BITV test.
The 4.6 installation was tested according to the 60 test steps resulting from the 50 requirements of WCAG 2.1 (conformities A and AA). Testing was carried out according to the four principles of WCAG 2.1. 13 guidelines were assigned to these principles, which form the basic objectives for the creation of accessible web content.




- Perceptibility


This includes, for example, whether there are text alternatives, whether things are customizable and distinguishable.
- Usability


It is tested whether the system can be operated with a keyboard and how good the navigability and input modalities are.
- Comprehensibility


It plays a role here whether texts are legible, operation is intuitive and whether there are input aids, for example.
- Robustness


WCAG principle: "Content must be robust enough to be reliably interpreted by a wide range of user agents, including assistive technologies." This point also includes analysis for correct syntax.
The test steps have increased to 85 in 2021 and even 98 in 2022.


## Legal requirements
National associations such as the EU, states and federal states have reacted to the WCAG and passed various laws to implement the guidelines.
First of all, it should be noted that any national law that contradicts an EU regulation is immediately ineffective. This is because a European regulation automatically becomes part of the national legal system when it is promulgated and does not have to be transposed into national law by the individual EU member states.
A European directive, on the other hand, only comes into effect after a period of time specified in the legal text. The objectives set out in a European directive are not yet legally binding for the local authorities before this sometimes protracted process of incorporation into German legislation. In any case, the form and means of implementation are left to the respective member state itself, so that in specific cases there can and will always be different court decisions at national and European level.
The Barrier-free Information Technology Ordinance (BITV), which is based on WCAG 1.0 and first came into force in Germany in 2002, is intended to ensure the comprehensive and fundamentally unrestricted barrier-free design of modern information and communication technology in accordance with Section 1 and therefore applies to


- websites
- mobile applications (apps)
- electronically supported administrative processes and
- graphical program interfaces
of the federal government.


The federal states of Germany have also passed corresponding laws based on this, such as Lower Saxony:
The NBGG, the Lower Saxony Disability Equality Act (25.11.2007; version of 25.10.2018, valid from 02.11.2018) has the following most important contents:
- (ยง 9 a) public bodies must make their websites and mobile applications accessible
- (ยง 9b) public bodies must publish a statement on accessibility that also names places that are exceptionally not accessible and alternatives to them
- which contains a reference to enforcement procedures and links to arbitration bodies


## New legal situation and framework conditions
The EU Directive 2016/2012 of the European Parliament and Council on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies, which is aimed at the member states, has been in force since October 26, 2016. These must transpose the directive into national law.
The entry into force of the EU directive and the so-called harmonization in the member states have given new impetus to the discussion and also the actions in terms of accessibility at both federal and state level.
The BITV 2.0 (which came into force on May 25, 2019) implements the EU Directive 2016/2012, which was not already implemented in 2018 in the updated Disability Equality Act (BGG). The BITV 2.0 has been developed since 2007 in a working group made up of representatives from disability associations, the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, the Federal Office of Administration and research and technology.
The new legal situation has resulted in changes to the framework conditions: monitoring bodies for barrier-free Internet have existed for some time, for example in Lower Saxony (in accordance with Section 9c NBGG)
It must be said that politicians have reacted hesitantly to the legal situation. In addition, some of the monitoring bodies are actually difficult to find on the Internet.


The monitoring bodies have the following tasks
- periodic monitoring of whether and to what extent the services offered by public bodies meet accessibility requirements
- Identification of deficiencies
- Advice, training, awareness-raising programs
- Preparation of a report (e.g. for the state parliament)
- Support for the so-called arbitration board
The arbitration board is set up by the State Commissioner for People with Disabilities. It is responsible for the so-called enforcement procedure (in accordance with Art. 9 of EU Directive 2016/2012).
The conciliation body must:
- act independently and impartially
- Handle/disclose procedural rules transparently
- Provide participants in the conciliation procedure with a fair hearing
- guarantee confidentiality
- ensure barrier-free communication
- and may request the monitoring body to review individual public bodies


## What does this mean for Stud.IP and its operators?
Universities as public corporations and also associations/clubs are usually considered public institutions, therefore they are subject to the respective federal or state jurisdiction and must therefore design barrier-free applications.
They must report on the status of accessibility and establish feedback processes, which also applies to Stud.IP and other LMSs. This includes:
1. a statement that is included on websites and names contact persons and provides information on the status of accessibility, (https://gitlab.studip.de/studip/studip/-/wikis/Barrierefreiheit#erkl%C3%A4rung-zur-barrierefreiheit-der-websiteapp-und-feedbackmechanismus)
2. a technical feedback mechanism that allows feedback on barriers to be given directly on the objects or pages that present barriers (https://gitlab.studip.de/studip/studip/-/wikis/Barrierefreiheit#erkl%C3%A4rung-zur-barrierefreiheit-der-websiteapp-und-feedbackmechanismus)
3. personal offices that take care of the removal of barriers. The enforcement agencies in Bavaria asked the universities directly about the status of accessibility. Many of them want the LMSs to be certified so that this certificate can be submitted to the authorities. However, it is not possible to certify the software itself, as it cannot be considered separately from the content that many teachers, among others, post.
A remedy has already been found for the first two points. It is already possible to report barriers to the system from anywhere and has been available as a plugin since 2021 (runs from Stud.IP 4.4). The content and contact details must be stored by the respective location.


This also means that:
- the public bodies must fear that complaints will accumulate and bugfixing/improvements to plugins and the core will be required, resulting in increased time/staffing requirements
- they can be monitored directly by the supervisory bodies
- that too few employees are familiarized with the topic and time must be planned for training/further qualification
- if it comes to an enforcement or even arbitration procedure, the public body is obliged to support it.


## Implementation project to make Stud.IP more accessible
The above-mentioned catalog of measures was cross-financed by seven universities and individual work packages were commissioned. This resulted in an implementation project at data-quest, which will run from September 2021 to April 2023. One result is the documentation and guidelines on how to make programming more accessible in future.


## Ensuring the accessibility of new program code
As is usual in open source projects, many different people from different locations are programming the Stud.IP software and extending/modernizing it not only with plugins, but also with new code in the core. This naturally poses a challenge when it comes to ensuring the quality of the published software and checking it against a wide range of criteria. However, the project has had a noticeable impact on the awareness and motivation of developers on the subject of accessibility and has already led to more accessible program code. The community has reacted to the topic with complete openness, and new work packages are now always considered from the outset in terms of accessibility.
The central committee that decides which work on the Stud.IP code is included in new versions and which criteria they must meet is the core group. In 2022, a new responsibility for the area of "accessibility" was created here, which not only serves as a point of contact for questions relating to accessible programming, but also checks any code that is to be integrated into the Stud.IP core for accessible design and operation and, if necessary, may veto its integration. This ensures that the changes made in the implementation project are not only preserved in the documentation, but that the program code of Stud.IP will also be further developed in the future with regard to accessibility.
