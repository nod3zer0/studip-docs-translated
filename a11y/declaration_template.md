This declaration on accessibility applies to the Stud.IP installation (5.x) under the [add URL of; please specify version and date] of the [add operator of Stud.IP installation].


As a public body within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/2102, we endeavor to make our websites and mobile applications accessible in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Disability Equality Act (BGG) and the Accessible Information Technology Ordinance (BITV 2.0) for the implementation of Directive (EU) 2016/2102.

### Status of compatibility with the requirements


The accessibility requirements are set out in sections 3 (1) to (4) and 4 of BITV 2.0, which was issued on the basis of section 12d BGG.


The verification of compliance with the requirements is based on
an assessment carried out by Materna Information & Communications SE in the period from the end of January to the beginning of February 2021. The benchmark for the audit is EN 301 549 and the A and AA status of WCAG 2.1. The requirements of WCAG 2.1 (conformity levels A and AA) were checked using the 60 test steps of the BITV/WCAG test.


The review refers to Stud.IP release 5.x. [Plugins and content must be checked on a site-specific basis and documented/this declaration adapted if necessary. Please add if necessary].


This Stud.IP installation is not fully compliant with the accessibility regulations that apply to us. In detail:


- Heading hierarchies are not fully complied with on some pages.
- In some cases, there are no, incorrect or inadequate alternatives for images, control elements and graphic elements.
- In some cases, graphics and control elements lack correct markup so that they cannot be correctly recognized by assistance systems.
- The language in alternative texts is sometimes given in English without the language change being correctly indicated.
- List entries, tables (columns) and forms are sometimes not correctly labeled.
- The visible order of page elements sometimes differs from the order in the source text.
- The minimum requirement for contrast is not met everywhere.
- The keyboard control is not fully usable.
- The home page does not provide explanations about the website in plain language and in German sign language.


In addition, content posted by users, e.g. PDFs or videos, may have barriers.


Stud.IP is currently being revised with regard to accessibility. The following measures to reduce barriers are expected to be included in the release of Stud.IP 5.1 and 5.2:


- Attributes and alternative texts will be added and corrected so that screen readers can correctly interpret buttons, links, controls and graphics and output suitable texts.
- The hierarchies of headings and the order of page elements will be revised/corrected.
- Language markups are standardized.
- List entries, tables (columns) and forms are correctly labeled and meaningfully linked.
- An option to change the contrast is implemented.
