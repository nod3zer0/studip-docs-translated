## PHP files

The vast majority of Stud.IP source files are PHP files, some of which contain HTML parts. In the medium term, PHP code and HTML output will be separated more strictly - see [Create HTML output](html output).

## Coding style

All files must adhere to the [Coding standards](CodingStyle).

## Graphics

Graphics are used in JPG and PNG formats.  Rule of thumb: PNG for images with transparency and small graphics, which have a smaller file size than PNG. For everything else, use JPG.
