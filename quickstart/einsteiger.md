### Programming for Stud.IP


Before you start contributing to the development of Stud.IP, you should know what [Stud.IP CoreGroup, StEPs, TICs, Lifters and BIESTs](../rules/introduction) are.


It is also important to adhere to the [coding style](../coding-style) so that the written code can be understood more quickly by other Stud.IP developers. In this context, the [naming conventions](../coding-style#naming-conventions) and the rules for [PHP file formatting](../coding-style#php-file-formatting) are also important.


Here is an outdated [workshop](http://develop.studip.de/studip/download/force_download/0/8217c5e9c3b82ab83e388d8aa2ce339f/studip_programmierung_20111222.pdf) from 2011 by Andr√© Noack with a general overview.


### Development system


To develop for Stud.IP you should have a computer with a web server,
at least PHP 7.2, a MySQL database, git and a development
development environment is installed. How all this
is set up is described in [the article on the development environment](./development-environment).


There are also some [commands](./tips-to-get-started) for the Unix shell, which facilitate development in a large software system such as Stud.IP.




### The Stud.IP system


#### Stud.IP "Pages"


In Stud.IP, new pages are not added as PHP scripts, but via the framework [Trails](./trails). In this framework, pages are divided into [Controller](./trails#der-controller), which contain the program logic, and views, which take over the display. They are generated by so-called [Flexi-Templates](./flexi-templates), which are PHP files to which objects and variables from the controller are transferred.


In order to be able to call a controller, it is necessary to add it to the global [Navigation](Navigation). The procedure for attaching differs between controllers in plugins and Stud.IP-internal controllers.


#### Database access


Internally Stud.IP uses PDO to access database tables. These accesses are abstracted via [SORM (SimpleORMap)](./simpleormap). This is a small framework that handles the conversion of database entries into objects.


#### Translation


Stud.IP is available in two languages: German and English. German character strings are used in the source code, which are translated into English using the PHP function `gettext`. The procedure is different for PHP and JavaScript code:


* [in PHP](Howto/Internationalization#internationalization-in-php-code)
* [in JavaScript](Howto/Internationalization#internationalization-injs-code)




#### Plugins


Plugins are an important component of Stud.IP. They can be used to change the way Stud.IP works or to add new functions to Stud.IP.
